		<h1>Part 1</h1>
		Here's the screenshots-
		of no shear, only shear and all.

		Here is pinned4 with default params

		On varying stiffness, we can see that the cloth droops easily for lower stiffness (here 500), and it stays firm for higher stiffness. <br>
		We see the reverse efftec for density. The reasoning for this is just kx = ma. Since m represented the density of the cloth (or the mass on one particle in our discretized cloth).
		<br>
		So, x = ma/k and so a higher density causes more drooping than a lower one.
		<br> First is pics with varying stiffness, we used k= 500 and 50,000 <br>

		<br>
		Then is varying density, we used rho = 1 and 150 <br>

		I can't really capture the effect of the damping factor in an image, but it seems to control the amount of time it takes for the cloth to come to rest. <br>
		Higher damping factor means time to rst is lesser. When we set it equal to 0, the cloth stays oscillating forever. <br>

		<h3>Part 3</h3>
		Here's the resting cloth. <br>

		Here's the cloth on the ball with varying levels of stiffness.
		<img src="Screen Shot 2024-04-02 at 10.18.07 PM.png" 
     width="300" 
     height="300" /><img src="Screen Shot 2024-04-02 at 10.19.17 PM.png"

     height="300" />
		<img src="Screen Shot 2024-04-05 at 10.06.43 PM.png" 
     width="300" 
     height="300" />
		<br>
		It can be seen that as we increase the stiffness, it is harder for the cloth to drape nicely. And smaller stiffness folds very comfortably.

		<h4>Part 4</h4>
		Here's pictures of a default cloth falling on itself. <br>

     width="300" 
     height="300" />
		<br>
		If we increase stiffness, just like all the previous parts, the cloth is not able to fold nicely. <br>
		For high spring const, the cloth almost spreads out fully in its resting state. For low const it continues to fold nicely as seen below. <br>

		As in all the cases before this, the effect for density is reverse, as seen below-

		<h5>Part 5</h5>
		Shader programs in GLSL are domain specific programs that are able to run quickly on GPUs to provide a cheap alternative to direct ray-tracing.<br>
		Shader programs have two parts: A vertex shader - which assigns vertex attributes.<br>
		And A fragment shader - which assigns an RGB-alpha vector for each pixel by interpolating.<br>
		Data contained in the vertex attributes are manipulated in the fragment shader to produce different material effects. <br>
		After the pixel values corresponding to each vertex are determined , the fragment shader interpolates between them. <br>
		Blinn-Phong Shading model is a sum of three different lights: the ambient light, diffuse light, and specular reflections. <br>
		Ambient light is a constant term affecting all objects equally.<br>
		Diffuser lighting is local and accounts for illumination source position. We compute how bright a point is with cosin-law and inverse square law. <br>
		Specular reflection accounts for illumination source position, and the viewing position to produce glare. It also uses inverse-square and cosine laws, we just vary the coefficient and use a different angle.<br>
		images are presented below-<br>
		First is only diffuse, specular and ambient components in blinn phong. I varied the values of all of them coefficients based on the image to get the prettiest image. <br>

		Here is all of them combined <br>

		Here's a custom texture. (Amogus) <br>

		Finally, here's the bump vs displacement shaders for -o 16 -a 16 and -o 128 -a 128. Bump mapping seems to perform better than displacement mapping for this low sampling rate. <br>
		This is clear from the strange blockiness of the sphere evident in the 16x16 displacement mapping image. Such blockiness happens since we are interpolating across a small number of samples. <br>
		However, for higher frequencies, displacement is much much better as it is able to actually give the viewer a clear textural definition. This is absent for bump mapping and it just seems like we plastered a wallpaper onto the sphere when compared to displacement mapping. <br>
