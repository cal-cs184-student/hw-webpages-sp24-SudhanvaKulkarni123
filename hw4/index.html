		Shader programs in GLSL are domain specific programs that are able to run quickly on GPUs to provide a cheap alternative to direct ray-tracing.<br>
		Shader programs have two parts: A vertex shader - which assigns vertex attributes.<br>
		And A fragment shader - which assigns an RGB-alpha vector for each pixel by interpolating.<br>
		Data contained in the vertex attributes are manipulated in the fragment shader to produce different material effects. <br>
		After the pixel values corresponding to each vertex are determined , the fragment shader interpolates between them. <br>
		Blinn-Phong Shading model is a sum of three different lights: the ambient light, diffuse light, and specular reflections. <br>
		Ambient light is a constant term affecting all objects equally.<br>
		Diffuser lighting is local and accounts for illumination source position. We compute how bright a point is with cosin-law and inverse square law. <br>
		Specular reflection accounts for illumination source position, and the viewing position to produce glare. It also uses inverse-square and cosine laws, we just vary the coefficient and use a different angle.<br>
